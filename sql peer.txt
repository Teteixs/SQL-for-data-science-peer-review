Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2683
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000 (id)
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000 (id)
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

	+------------------------+-----------+-----------+------------+-------------+
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	** On yelp lookup sql the fucnction like correlation,sqrt is not available so i copied data from the table above to r
	then compute the correlation between 2 pair of variable 
	The first one is fans and funny and these two variables has 13.58184% correlate to each other
	the second pair of variable is fans and useful and these two variables has 14.08044% correlate to each other
	Its obviously seen that the correlation between funs,funny and funs,useful has low relationship

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
   Yes it does.The group with 2-3 stars rating a wider rage distribution of hours

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    Yes it does.The group with 4-5 stars has differences number of reviews varied by time interval but the group with
	2-3 stars has the same number of review across the day
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
    A group with 4-5 stars was comprised of different location of business but the other group was represented the business
	which located around the same area
SQL code used for analysis:

	select hours,sum(review_count),postal_code,
	case
		when a.stars between 2 and 3 then '2-3 stars'
		when a.stars between 4 and 5 then '4-5 stars'
	end as stars_rating 
	from business a
	inner join hours b 
	on a.id = b.business_id
	where city = 'Las Vegas' 
		and stars_rating = '4-5 stars'
		and id in (
			select business_id from category 
			where category like '%services%'
					)
	group by hours,postal_code
	;	
	
	select hours,sum(review_count),postal_code,
	case
		when a.stars between 2 and 3 then '2-3 stars'
		when a.stars between 4 and 5 then '4-5 stars'
	end as stars_rating 
	from business a
	inner join hours b 
	on a.id = b.business_id
	where city = 'Las Vegas' 
		and stars_rating = '2-3 stars'
		and id in (
			select business_id from category 
			where category like '%services%'
					)
	group by hours,postal_code
	;	
	
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
      
	The number of open and closed business
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
    The average number of review between open and closed group     
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	+---------+---------------+----------------------+----------+
	| is_open | Average Stars | Average review count | Count id |
	+---------+---------------+----------------------+----------+
	|       0 |          3.52 |                 23.2 |     1520 |
	|       1 |          3.68 |                31.76 |     8480 |
	+---------+---------------+----------------------+----------+
	
	select is_open,round(avg(stars),2) as 'Average Stars',
	round(avg(review_count),2) as 'Average review count',
	count(distinct id) as 'Count id'
	from business
	group by is_open;
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
    
	Clustering user to find commonality and abnomality of user what features is correlated with
	user fan 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    
	The data that i use come from these lists of table below
	1. Business
	2. Category
	3. review
	4. User
	
	From the result table below , I've have summarize 2 main points
    1. From result it's obviously seen that restaurant category group has the high number of reviews and number of businesses.it's can implies that 
	a number of businesses in each category is correlated with the number of reviews count 
    2. From column "Number of review per user" its obviously seen that some business has a little number of reviewers  eventhougt they has a large  number of review count
